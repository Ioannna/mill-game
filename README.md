Mill game is a project that was explained during the JavaScript Webinar that
I have attended. In this app, users can play mill game simultaneously in
separate rooms. They also have the possibility to chat one another and see
the current status of the game(who is next, what is the next move, how many pieces has collected each player). 

Technologies used: JSX, CSS, React, Express and Socket.IO
